Thanks for checking out my Laravel blog source code.

To get this running you'll need your environment set up first. I heartily recomment either Laradock (Docker based Laravel environement) or Homestead - all you need is PHP and MySQL up and running.

To get set up:

1) Pull this to your local environment.
2) cp .env.example .env and enter your database credentials
2) php artisan migrate
3) You should be good to go!
